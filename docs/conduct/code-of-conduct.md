The Sumé community is dedicated to providing an inclusive and safe experience for everyone. The community is made up of a mixture of professionals from various fields, as well as volunteers from around the world, working in all aspects to make knowledge accessible and connect people passionate about the knowledge they want to share, learn and teach others.

Diversity is one of our great strengths, but it can also lead to communication problems and unhappiness. To that end, we have some basic rules that we ask people to follow. This code applies equally to all who are part of the Sumé community, founders, educators, mentors, and those who seek help and guidance.

This isn’t an exhaustive list of things that you can’t do. Instead, take it in its intended spirit - a guide to facilitate the enrichment of all of us and the technical and non-technical communities in which we participate.

This code of conduct applies to all spaces managed by the Sumé project. This includes Discord, GitHub, Social Networks (Reddit, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram), the mailing lists, Sumé events, and any other forums created by the project team that the community uses for communication. In addition, violations of this code outside these spaces can affect a person's ability to participate in them.

If you believe that someone is violating the code of conduct, we ask that you report it by email *[conduct@sume.com](mailto:conduct@sume.com).* All reports will be kept confidential. In some cases, we can determine that a public statement will need to be made. If so, the identities of all victims and reporters will remain confidential, unless those individuals instruct us otherwise.

We have the right and responsibility to remove comments or other contributions that are not in accordance with this Code of Conduct or to temporarily or permanently ban any member for other behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

- **Be friendly and patient.**
- **Be welcoming and use inclusive language.** We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, color, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.
- **Be considerate.** Your work will be used by other people, just as you will depend on other people's work. Whatever decision you make will affect users and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when making decisions.
- **Be respectful.** Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for bad behavior and poor manners. We may all experience some frustration from time to time, but we cannot allow that frustration to become a personal attack. It’s important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.
- **Be careful in the words that you choose.** We are a community that values ethics and we conduct ourselves ethically. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior aren't acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:
    - Derogatory public/private comments with threats or offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion.
    - Unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment.
    - Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.
    - Discriminatory jokes and language.
    - Posting (or threatening to post) others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission.
    - Posting sexually explicit or violent material.
    - Unwanted sexual advances and attention.
    - Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
- **Be constructive.** Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time. When we disagree, try to understand why. It is important that we resolve disagreements constructively. Remember that we’re different and different people have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn’t mean that they’re wrong. Don’t forget that it is human to err and blaming each other doesn’t get us anywhere. Instead, focus on helping to resolve issues and learning from mistakes.
